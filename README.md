# Fraud-Detection-ML
Built a machine learning model to detect fraud in 6M+ financial transactions. Handled missing data, encoded categories, removed outliers safely, and dealt with class imbalance. Trained models like Random Forest and XGBoost, evaluated with AUC and F1-score, and identified key fraud features to suggest prevention strategies.
